techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows
that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a
self-supervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks

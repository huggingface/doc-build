data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain
state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual classification, unsupervised and supervised machine translation. On XNLI, our
approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, we
obtain 34.3 BLEU on WMT\u201916 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9 BLEU. On supervised

In this work, we extend this approach to multiple languages and show the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining. We

data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain
state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual classification, unsupervised and supervised machine translation. On XNLI, our
approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, we
obtain 34.3 BLEU on WMT\u201916 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9 BLEU. On supervised
machine translation, we obtain a new state of the art of 38.5 BLEU on WMT\u201916 Romanian-English, outperforming the
previous best approach by more than 4 BLEU.

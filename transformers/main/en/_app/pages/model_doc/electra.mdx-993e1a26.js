and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when transferred to
downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a
more sample-efficient pretraining task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach
corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead
of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that
predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments
demonstrate this new pretraining task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens
rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our
approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are
particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained
using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale,
where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when

and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when transferred to
downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a
more sample-efficient pretraining task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach
corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead
of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that
predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments
demonstrate this new pretraining task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens
rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our
approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are
particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained
using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale,
where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when

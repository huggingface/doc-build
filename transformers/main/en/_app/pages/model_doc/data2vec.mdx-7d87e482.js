objectives differ widely because they were developed with a single modality in mind. To get us closer to general
self-supervised learning, we present data2vec, a framework that uses the same learning method for either speech,
NLP or computer vision. The core idea is to predict latent representations of the full input data based on a
masked view of the input in a selfdistillation setup using a standard Transformer architecture.
Instead of predicting modality-specific targets such as words, visual tokens or units of human speech which
are local in nature, data2vec predicts contextualized latent representations that contain information from
the entire input. Experiments on the major benchmarks of speech recognition, image classification, and
natural language understanding demonstrate a new state of the art or competitive performance to predominant approaches.

objectives differ widely because they were developed with a single modality in mind. To get us closer to general
self-supervised learning, we present data2vec, a framework that uses the same learning method for either speech,
NLP or computer vision. The core idea is to predict latent representations of the full input data based on a
masked view of the input in a selfdistillation setup using a standard Transformer architecture.
Instead of predicting modality-specific targets such as words, visual tokens or units of human speech which
are local in nature, data2vec predicts contextualized latent representations that contain information from
the entire input. Experiments on the major benchmarks of speech recognition, image classification, and
natural language understanding demonstrate a new state of the art or competitive performance to predominant approaches.

approaches is challenging. Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes,
and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication
study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and
training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every
model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results
highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently
reported improvements. We release our models and code.`),W=l(),le=n("p"),ke=r("Tips:"),B=l(),G=n("ul"),se=n("li"),O=r("This implementation is the same as "),de=n("a"),Q=r("BertModel"),Te=r(` with a tiny embeddings tweak as well as a setup

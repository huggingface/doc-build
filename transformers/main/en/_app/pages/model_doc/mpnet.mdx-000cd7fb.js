Since BERT neglects dependency among predicted tokens, XLNet introduces permuted language modeling (PLM) for
pre-training to address this problem. However, XLNet does not leverage the full position information of a sentence and
thus suffers from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MPNet, a novel
pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. MPNet leverages the
dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT), and takes auxiliary position
information as input to make the model see a full sentence and thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in
XLNet). We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale dataset (over 160GB text corpora) and fine-tune on a variety of
down-streaming tasks (GLUE, SQuAD, etc). Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large
margin, and achieves better results on these tasks compared with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods (e.g.,

Since BERT neglects dependency among predicted tokens, XLNet introduces permuted language modeling (PLM) for
pre-training to address this problem. However, XLNet does not leverage the full position information of a sentence and
thus suffers from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MPNet, a novel
pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. MPNet leverages the
dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT), and takes auxiliary position
information as input to make the model see a full sentence and thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in
XLNet). We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale dataset (over 160GB text corpora) and fine-tune on a variety of
down-streaming tasks (GLUE, SQuAD, etc). Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large
margin, and achieves better results on these tasks compared with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods (e.g.,

position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE comes with valuable properties such as flexibility of
being expand to any sequence lengths, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and
capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. As a result, the enhanced
transformer with rotary position embedding, or RoFormer, achieves superior performance in tasks with long texts. We

capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. As a result, the enhanced

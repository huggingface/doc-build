pre-trained language models. We show that decoupled embeddings provide increased modeling flexibility, allowing us to
significantly improve the efficiency of parameter allocation in the input embedding of multilingual models. By
reallocating the input embedding parameters in the Transformer layers, we achieve dramatically better performance on
standard natural language understanding tasks with the same number of parameters during fine-tuning. We also show that
allocating additional capacity to the output embedding provides benefits to the model that persist through the
fine-tuning stage even though the output embedding is discarded after pre-training. Our analysis shows that larger
output embeddings prevent the model\u2019s last layers from overspecializing to the pre-training task and encourage
Transformer representations to be more general and more transferable to other tasks and languages. Harnessing these
findings, we are able to train models that achieve strong performance on the XTREME benchmark without increasing the

reallocating the input embedding parameters in the Transformer layers, we achieve dramatically better performance on
standard natural language understanding tasks with the same number of parameters during fine-tuning. We also show that
allocating additional capacity to the output embedding provides benefits to the model that persist through the
fine-tuning stage even though the output embedding is discarded after pre-training. Our analysis shows that larger
output embeddings prevent the model\u2019s last layers from overspecializing to the pre-training task and encourage
Transformer representations to be more general and more transferable to other tasks and languages. Harnessing these

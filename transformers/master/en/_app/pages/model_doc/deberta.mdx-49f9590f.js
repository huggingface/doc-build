language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with
disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the
disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and
position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their
contents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to
predict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency
of model pretraining and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of
the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9%
(90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and

language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with
disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the
disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and
position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their
contents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to
predict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency
of model pretraining and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of
the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9%
(90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and

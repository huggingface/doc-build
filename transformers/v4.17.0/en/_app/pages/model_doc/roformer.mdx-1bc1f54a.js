different positions in the sequence. We investigate various methods to encode positional information in
transformer-based language models and propose a novel implementation named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE). The
proposed RoPE encodes absolute positional information with rotation matrix and naturally incorporates explicit relative
position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE comes with valuable properties such as flexibility of
being expand to any sequence lengths, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and
capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. As a result, the enhanced
transformer with rotary position embedding, or RoFormer, achieves superior performance in tasks with long texts. We
release the theoretical analysis along with some preliminary experiment results on Chinese data. The undergoing
experiment for English benchmark will soon be updated.`),ce=l(),j=n("p"),ge=a("Tips:"),W=l(),ae=n("ul"),ie=n("li"),B=a(`RoFormer is a BERT-like autoencoding model with rotary position embeddings. Rotary position embeddings have shown

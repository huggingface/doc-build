pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all
permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive
formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into
pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large

better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on
corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a
pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive
pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all
permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive
formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into
pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large

'>> Review: Bought this for handling miscellaneous aircraft parts and hanger "stuff" that I needed to organize; it really fit the bill. The unit arrived quickly, was well packaged and arrived intact (always a good sign). There are five wall mounts-- three on the top and two on the bottom. I wanted to mount it on the wall, so all I had to do was to remove the top two layers of plastic drawers, as well as the bottom corner drawers, place it when I wanted and mark it; I then used some of the new plastic screw in wall anchors (the 50 pound variety) and it easily mounted to the wall. Some have remarked that they wanted dividers for the drawers, and that they made those. Good idea. My application was that I needed something that I can see the contents at about eye level, so I wanted the fuller-sized drawers. I also like that these are the new plastic that doesn\\'t get brittle and split like my older plastic drawers did. I like the all-plastic construction. It\\'s heavy duty enough to hold metal parts, but being made of plastic it\\'s not as heavy as a metal frame, so you can easily mount it to the wall and still load it up with heavy stuff, or light stuff. No problem there. For the money, you can\\'t beat it. Best one of these I\\'ve bought to date-- and I\\'ve been using some version of these for over forty years.'`,highlighted:`<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;&gt;&gt; Title: Worked in front position, not rear&#x27;</span>

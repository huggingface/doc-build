be deployed to resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating
the popular BERT model. Like the original BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic, that is, it can be generically applied to
various downstream NLP tasks via simple fine-tuning. Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT_LARGE, while
equipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks.
To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially designed teacher model, an inverted-bottleneck incorporated BERT_LARGE
model. Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT. Empirical studies show that MobileBERT is
4.3x smaller and 5.5x faster than BERT_BASE while achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the
natural language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUEscore o 77.7 (0.6 lower than BERT_BASE), and 62 ms
latency on a Pixel 4 phone. On the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 question answering task, MobileBERT achieves a dev F1 score of

be deployed to resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose MobileBERT for compressing and accelerating
the popular BERT model. Like the original BERT, MobileBERT is task-agnostic, that is, it can be generically applied to
various downstream NLP tasks via simple fine-tuning. Basically, MobileBERT is a thin version of BERT_LARGE, while
equipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully designed balance between self-attentions and feed-forward networks.
To train MobileBERT, we first train a specially designed teacher model, an inverted-bottleneck incorporated BERT_LARGE
model. Then, we conduct knowledge transfer from this teacher to MobileBERT. Empirical studies show that MobileBERT is
4.3x smaller and 5.5x faster than BERT_BASE while achieving competitive results on well-known benchmarks. On the
natural language inference tasks of GLUE, MobileBERT achieves a GLUEscore o 77.7 (0.6 lower than BERT_BASE), and 62 ms
latency on a Pixel 4 phone. On the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 question answering task, MobileBERT achieves a dev F1 score of

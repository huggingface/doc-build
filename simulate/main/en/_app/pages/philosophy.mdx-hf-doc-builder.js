In our investiguations, we found that the current lanscape for simulation environments and synthetic data creation has a couple of limitations:
- Very fragmented - each set of simulation environments is usually isolated and separated from the others by being tied to a specific engine (Unity, Gibson, Habitat, etc)
- Building environments often requires knowledge and skills that are not in the toolbox of the typical AI/ML researchers (knowledge of C++/C#)
- Frameworks tend to focus on one domain/application, e.g. focusing on RL, synthetic data generation, NLP, self-driving cars but the field is increasingly cross applications/modalities
- It's often not easy to share a new environment or a modification of an environment wihtout having to modify a library
- Environment visualization/debugging tools can be difficult to find
